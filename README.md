# Winning strategies in team play battle royale games: insights from the Playerunknown's Battleground Game Data

This is a course project I did with Ruixuan Li for the course "Application of Statistical Modeling" taught by Dr. Yajuan Si in the Program in Survey Methodology, Univerisity of Michigan.

In this project, we used gaming behavior and outcome data from [PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) Developer API](https://developer.pubg.com) that were collected and cleaned by Kaggle and made available on a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction). We used k-mean clustering method to score 4 core competency of the player from their performance: attacking, self-supporting, cooperation and moving. Then we applied regression tree method to predict the game outcome from these 4 types of scores and analyze the winning strategies.
